Hello, world! 

I'm Magda, a software engineer based in New York City.

My primarily interest is full-stack development and I'm currently working at [**Velvet Disruption**] (https://velvetdisruption.com).

Outside of work, I'm interested in literature and art. I also write and make tech-related content.
